One Love
========

### Overview
One love is a web-based application designed to make managing multiple hosts easier.

It uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) roles which are shared via [Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com) hosting providers APIs and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to make a powerful interface which controls all the aspects of the cloud infrastructure.

The main idea behind One Love is to automate the process of seting-up and configuring different host machines on different host providers.

You will be able to group multiple hosts together, and apply certain roles to the every group member therefor making the management of large number of machines a lot easier.
